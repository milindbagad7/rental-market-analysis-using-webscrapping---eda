## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the residential rental market by scraping real-time property data from online real-estate platforms and applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover rental pricing trends.

As no clean public dataset was available, the dataset was created from scratch using web scraping, followed by data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.  
The project compares the rental markets of Pune and Nashik to highlight pricing differences, demand patterns, and influencing factors.

---

## Business Objective
- Build a structured rental dataset using web scraping  
- Clean and preprocess raw, unstructured property data  
- Analyze rental price patterns using EDA  
- Identify key factors influencing rent  
- Generate actionable insights for tenants, owners, and real-estate stakeholders  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- BeautifulSoup  
- Requests  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Web Scraping Process
1. Imported required libraries (BeautifulSoup, Requests)
2. Selected a real-estate listing website
3. Extracted property-level information:
   - Rent
   - BHK type
   - Carpet area
   - Furnishing status
   - Floor details
   - City and locality
4. Stored extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame

---

## Data Preparation
- Removed currency symbols, commas, and text units
- Converted text columns into numeric and categorical features
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized formats and units
- Parsed multiple attributes from single HTML tags using regex

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Analysis Performed
- BHK-wise distribution analysis
- Furnishing status distribution
- Rent distribution trends
- Average rent by BHK and furnishing
- Carpet area vs rent relationship
- City-wise comparison between Pune and Nashik

## Key Insights
- 2 BHK and 3 BHK flats are the most commonly available
- Most rental properties fall in the ₹15,000–₹40,000 range
- Rent increases non-linearly as BHK size increases
- Furnished flats consistently command higher rent
- Strong positive correlation between carpet area and rent
- Pune is significantly more expensive than Nashik
- Nashik offers stable and budget-friendly rental pricing

---

## Experience & Challenges
- Built a dataset from scratch due to lack of public data
- Worked with highly unstructured website content
- Performed extensive text cleaning and regex parsing
- Managed missing values and inconsistent formats

---

## Conclusion & Learnings
- Successfully developed a clean, structured rental dataset
- Identified BHK, carpet area, furnishing, city, and locality as major rent drivers
- Discovered clear rental trends and city-wise pricing differences
- Demonstrated end-to-end skills in web scraping, data cleaning, EDA, and insight generation
